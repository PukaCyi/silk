# Internal
Silk, the project that powers banami.nekoweb.org, a personal website by [Banami](https://banami.nekoweb.org/about)

# About
Silk is the successor to Banami (codename). It is designed to be as simplistic as possible and aligns with websites from the early 2000s, which look fantastic in contrast to modern sites that often overdo their UI/looks.
