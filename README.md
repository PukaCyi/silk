Silk, the project that powers banami.nekoweb.org, a personal website by [Banami](https://banami.nekoweb.org/about)

# About
Silk is the successor to [Banami (codename)](https://github.com/PukaCyi/Banami). It is designed to be as simplistic as possible. It aligns with some Nekoweb websites and Pyohato's Nebulamancers site (before being closed as he left the internet), which look fantastic in contrast to modern sites that often overdo their UI/looks.
